'''
Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates
the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you sell.

Example: given [9,11,8,5,7,10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 and sell at 10.
